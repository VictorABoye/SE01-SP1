Read the following information and make a choice!\nIt’s true that one person alone can make only a tiny dent in the global climate problem. It’s just a really huge problem that requires large-scale action and policy changes to address.\nHowever, if many people collectively made changes to their diets, that could start to add up.\nThat’s why our everyday food choice can make a difference to the overall climate impact, and can help us limit the global average temperature to two degrees above the pre-industrial effort, which is the main goal behind the Paris Temperature goal.\n",
    "choices": ["Oatmeal with some fresh fruit on top", "Triple-Beef Cheeseburger"],
    "consequences": ["Good choice! As a reward you have gained +5 climate points! Grains and other plant foods are far less resource-intensive to produce than animal foods like dairy, eggs and meat.\nNot only are grains climate-friendly but grains are also among the healthiest grains on earth and very beneficial for your health!\nMuch better than unnecessarily contributing to the livestock production, which is accounting for an estimated 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions.",
      "\nThat was a bad choice. Consequently, you have lost 5 climate points!\nIn general, beef and lamb have the biggest climate footprint per gram of protein, while plant-based foods tend to have the smallest impact.\nLivestock production is responsible for an estimated 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions. You need to turn your diet around and consider what you eat.\nThis doesn't mean you should become a vegetarian, but rather look for substitutes to your breakfast to reduce your climate footprint and stay healthy as well\n"]

The impact of the covid-19 pandemic, where many were in lockdown, not only influenced people, but also the environment, emissions dropped while it was ongoing.\nSeeing this we can see that our actions have an impact in the world.",

You could at least take the bus or train.You’ve lost 10 climate points!\nOn average, a typical car emits 4,6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, with about 171 grams per kilometer. Not only do cars emit carbon dioxide, but they also emit methane and nitrous oxide, these gasses have a bigger impact on global warming.",
      "Bad choice, you could have walked. You’ve lost 5 climate points!\nHowever, better than taking the car, but buses still emit 82 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer. If the distance is too far to walk, taking the bus is a good choice, but in this instance, you do not have far to walk.",
      "Bad choice, but still better than taking the car. You’ve lost 5 climate points!\nDepending on the type of train, the emission can vary from 6 to 41 grams per kilometer. You obviously cannot walk everywhere, so for longer distances taking the train or similar is an okay choice.",
